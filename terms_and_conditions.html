          By downloading or using the app, these terms will
          automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
          that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not
          allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or
          our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to
          extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try
          to translate the app into other languages or make derivative
          versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright,
          database rights, and other intellectual property rights related
          to it, still belong to Vijay kapoor.

        <p>
          Vijay kapoor is committed to ensuring that the app is
          as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
          reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for
          its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never
          charge you for the app or its services without making it very
          clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Blind 75 app stores and processes personal data that
          you have provided to us, to provide my
          Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and
          access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do
          not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
          removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
          official operating system of your device. It could make your
          phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
          compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean
          that the Blind 75 app won’t work properly or at all.

          You should be aware that there are certain things that
          Vijay kapoor will not take responsibility for. Certain
          functions of the app will require the app to have an active
          internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided
          by your mobile network provider, but Vijay kapoor
          cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
          functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t
          have any of your data allowance left.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
          should remember that the terms of the agreement with your
          mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
          be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
          the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
          other third-party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
          responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
          charges if you use the app outside of your home territory
          (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
          you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re
          using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
          received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
        </p>
        <p>
          Along the same lines, Vijay kapoor cannot always take
          responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
          make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
          battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service,
          Vijay kapoor cannot accept responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          With respect to Vijay kapoor’s responsibility for your
          use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to
          bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is
          updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
          to provide information to us so that we can make it available
          to you. Vijay kapoor accepts no liability for any
          loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
          relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
        </p>
        <p>
          At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
          currently available on Android &amp; iOS – the requirements for the
          both systems(and for any additional systems we
          decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
          and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
          using the app. Vijay kapoor does not promise that it
          will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
          and/or works with the Android &amp; iOS version that you have
          installed on your device. However, you promise to always
          accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may
          also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of
          it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
          Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
          rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;
          (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it
          from your device.
        </p>

          I may update our Terms and Conditions

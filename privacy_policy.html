        <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>

          Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to
          them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to

          acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method
          of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
          storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot
          guarantee its absolute security.
